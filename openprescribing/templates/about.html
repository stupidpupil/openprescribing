<h2>About</h2>

<p>OpenPrescribing is one of a range of projects built by Anna Powell-Smith and Ben Goldacre at the <a href="http://ebmdatalab.net">EBM Data Lab</a> to help make complex medical and scientific data more accessible and more impactful in the real world.</p>

<p>After several years' gestation, phase 1 of this project leading to beta launch in Dec 2015 was solely funded by the <a href="http://weahsn.net">West of England Academic Health Science Network</a> (£50,000) through Dr. Peter Brindle.</p>

<p>Phase 1 was greatly supported and improved by discussions with Dr Peter Brindle, Richard Croker, Dr Jeff Aronson, Prof Carl Heneghan, Dr Kamal Mahtani, Demeter Sztanko, Joel Hirst, Mark Gregory, Dr Julian Treadwell, and Peter Kirmond. The six initial indicative measures for practices and CCGs were developed in various discussions between Ben Goldacre, Jeff Aronson, Peter Brindle, Kamal Mahtani, and Richard Croker. Thanks all!</p>

<p>This site is currently in beta. If there are additional features you would like to see added to it, or you have any feedback, or bug reports, please tell us. If you have access to funding, we have very big plans for features we would like to add: <a href="mailto:mail@openprescribing.net">get in touch</a>!</p>

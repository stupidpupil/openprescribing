        chartDescription: 'Statins are the most commonly prescribed class of drug in the UK. Atorvastatin and Rosuvastatin are members of this class, and are both high-potency statins. There will always be reasons why occasional patients do better with a particular drug, but overall there is no good evidence that Rosuvastatin is better than atorvastatin. It is, however, vastly more expensive. When atorvastatin came off patent, and became cheap, practices tended to switch people away from expensive Rosuvastatin.',

        chartDescription: 'Rosiglitazone is an antidiabetic drug that turned out to increase the risk of heart problems, and was effectively withdrawn from the market. There is concern that the problems may have been a "class effect", covering other related drugs, and so doctors have tended to also stop using pioglitazone.

        chartDescription: 'Coxib drugs are an interesting illustration of a common phenomenon in medicine: the need to make a trade off between risk and benefit, in different patients. Long term use of NSAID painkillers puts patients at increased risk of gastric bleeds. Coxib painkillers are effective at treating pain, with lower risk of bleeding; but they are much more expensive, and come with a higher risk of cardiovascular problems. Overall, therefore, they are sensible to use in some patients, but if one area is prescribing a lot of coxibs (or very few) then that may mean that they have unusual patients, or it may mean that doctors\' thresholds for using them are different to their colleagues nationally.',
